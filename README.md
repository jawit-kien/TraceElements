# TraceElements
This respository contains a variety of generative grammars, in Kate Compton's Tracery formalism, 
for use in Twitterbots (via George Buckenham's CheapBotsDoneQuick.com)

In each case, a main Tracery grammar does the generation of short texts which CheapBotsDoneQuick.com can then tweet. 
If a response grammar is present, this will allow CheapBotsDoneQuick.com to generate an apt response to any mention of the bot's handle on Twitter.

The main grammar and the response grammar work together, with the latter using the non-terminals of the former to construct its replies.

In special cases, the main grammar and its response grammar are designed to talk back-and-forth with each other, 
thereby elorating a long threaded sequence of tweets over time. Check out the story-telling grammar in the Story generator directory.
In story generation, the main grammar generates the first event, and the response grammar generates subsequent events by responding to itself.

In the DBpedia riff generator, the main grammar generates a riff on some categorization (of a book, film, game, etc.) in DBpedia.
The response grammar then replies with a request -- to the story-telling bot above -- to generate a story on this theme. 
So, the response grammar responds by sending a tweet to another bot that will then talk to itself to build a story over multiple tweets.

Note that the size of the grammar in each case is often so large 
(it has been generated by a machine, from a database of relevant information, rather than hand-crafted)
that the grammar uses cryptic shorthands for its non-terminals, making the whole grammar hard to read for humans.
This is a necessary requirement if the grammar is to fit into the storage space allocated by CheapBotsDoneQuick.com
